## ✨ Profile

I am a **Java Backend Engineer** with a strong inclination towards  
**building scalable, resilient, and well-structured backend systems**.

I enjoy working at the system level —  
where **services communicate**, **messages flow**, and **architecture matters**.

My focus is not just on writing code,  
but on **designing systems that remain reliable as they grow**.
